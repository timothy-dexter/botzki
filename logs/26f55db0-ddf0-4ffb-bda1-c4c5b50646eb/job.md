I'll create a financial advisor agent that performs daily market research at 6 AM Pacific time. Let me develop a comprehensive job description for this task.

## Job Description for Financial Advisor Agent Setup

I'll create a financial advisor agent with the following components:

1. **Directory Structure**: Create `operating_system/FINANCIAL_ADVISOR/` with all necessary files
2. **Agent Definition**: `FINANCIAL_ADVISOR.md` - defines the bot's daily research tasks
3. **Report Template**: `FINANCIAL_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` - structured format for daily reports
4. **Daily Output**: `FINANCIAL_REPORT.md` - the generated daily report
5. **Cron Job**: Add a 6 AM Pacific daily market research job to `CRONS.json`
6. **Web Search Integration**: Configure the agent to use web search for financial data and news

The agent will:
- Run daily at 6 AM Pacific time before market open

- Analyze pre-market movements and overnight developments
- Generate a structured daily financial report
- Use web search for reliable financial data and news sources

**Files to create/modify:**
