Update the GitHub README.md file to include instructions for making the forked repository private during the installation/setup process.

### Requirements:

1. **Locate the installation/setup section** in the README.md file
2. **Add clear instructions** for making the forked repository private
3. **Place the instructions** at the appropriate point in the setup flow (likely right after forking)
4. **Include the reasoning** why the repository should be private (security, API keys, etc.)

### Instructions to Add:

After the fork step, add instructions like:

**Make Your Fork Private (Recommended)**

For security and to protect your API keys and configuration:

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to the **Danger Zone** section
4. Click **Change repository visibility**
5. Select **Make private** and confirm

This ensures your API keys, secrets, and custom configuration remain secure.

### Implementation Notes:

- Find the existing fork instructions in the README
- Add the privacy instructions immediately after the fork step
- Use clear, step-by-step formatting consistent with the existing style
- Include a brief explanation of why privacy is important for this type of repository
- Ensure the formatting matches the existing README style (headers, bullet points, etc.)
