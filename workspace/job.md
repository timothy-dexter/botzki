Create a Python script to fetch and display the 7-day weather forecast for Las Vegas, Nevada. The script should:

1. Use a free weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, or similar)
2. Fetch the 7-day forecast for Las Vegas
3. Display the results in a clear, readable format showing:
   - Date
   - High/low temperatures
   - Weather conditions
   - Any precipitation chances
4. Include error handling for API failures
5. Add instructions in comments or README for getting an API key
6. Make the output user-friendly and easy to read

The user wants to see Las Vegas weather for the next 7 days, so focus on creating a working solution they can run locally.
